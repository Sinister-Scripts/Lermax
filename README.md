# Disclaimer
This tool was not created for any harmful purposes, such as hacking for fun; quite the opposite, actually. It was made to keep programmers alive by the community for the community. Please use it at your own discretion and consider becoming a "good" hacker to help victims who got hacked.

We do NOT permit publishing Lermax to harm other people and hack them as Lermax is only used to help people who were hacked, basically like GreyHat.

We love Lermax very much and are grateful to Lermax's developers for creating such an amazing app, it's completely free. We don't demand any money :)

Lermax was programmed by l0ckerV5 (@teaml0ckerV5) and sinister (@0sinister), all credits to both of these people.
